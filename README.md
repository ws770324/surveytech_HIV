From sampling surveys, we learned several sampling methods including simple random sampling (SRS), stratified sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling â€¦ etc. In this project, we will use HIV follow-up data to estimate the incidences of syphilis and gonorrhea based on the simulation the of (1) SRS, (2) stratified sampling, and (3) cluster sampling and comparing the (1) unbiasedness, and (2) efficiency of the three sampling approaches.

# Data

The medical records of confirmed HIV cases were retrieved from the database of Kunming Prevention and Control Center, Taipei, Taiwan. This hospital is specialized for HIV/AIDS, STI, and drug abuse treatment in the northern Taiwan. According to the HIV Infection Control and Patient Rights Protection Act of Taiwan, all the confirmed HIV cases must be reported within 24 hours and followed at least once per month. Therefore, this database is the population of confirmed HIV cases, who received medical treatment at this hospital. To simplify the analysis, we focused on the 20,765 records happening in 2012, corresponding to 2,092 patients.
